# Invoice Payment Default Implementation - Summary

## Date: February 26, 2026
## Status: ✅ COMPLETED & TESTED

---

## Overview

Implemented a default payment method flag for invoice payments in the backoffice. When creating a sales payment, the system now automatically pre-selects the configured default payment account, reducing manual data entry.

**Key Decision:** Only implemented `is_invoice_default` flag. No POS default is needed since cashiers manually select payment methods at the point of sale.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Migration
**File:** `packages/db/migrations/0027_outlet_payment_default_flags.sql`

```sql
ALTER TABLE outlet_payment_method_mappings
  ADD COLUMN is_invoice_default TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 AFTER account_id;

CREATE INDEX idx_outlet_payment_invoice_default 
  ON outlet_payment_method_mappings(company_id, outlet_id, is_invoice_default);
```

- Added single boolean flag to mark default payment method for invoices
- Indexed for efficient lookup
- Applied and verified ✅

### 2. API Enhancements
**File:** `apps/api/app/api/settings/outlet-payment-method-mappings/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added `is_invoice_default` to request/response schema
- Validation: Rejects multiple invoice defaults per outlet
- Error code: `MULTIPLE_INVOICE_DEFAULTS`
- Returns flag in GET responses

**Example Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "outlet_id": 1,
  "mappings": [
    {
      "method_code": "CASH",
      "account_id": 160,
      "label": "Cash",
      "is_invoice_default": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Frontend - Settings UI
**File:** `apps/backoffice/src/features/account-mappings-page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added "Invoice Default" column with checkbox
- State management for tracking default selection
- Only one method can be checked at a time
- Clear UI description: "Pre-selected payment account when creating sales payments in backoffice. Cashiers will manually select payment methods in POS."

### 4. Frontend - Sales Payments UI
**File:** `apps/backoffice/src/features/sales-payments-page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Fetches payment method mappings on mount
- Auto-selects `account_id` from invoice default (if configured)
- Warning banner when no default is configured
- Users can still manually override the selection

**Warning Message:**
```
ℹ️ No invoice default payment method configured. 
   Please set a default in Settings → Payment Methods.
```

### 5. TypeScript Types
**File:** `apps/backoffice/src/hooks/use-outlet-payment-method-mappings.ts`

```typescript
export type PaymentMethodMapping = {
  method_code: string;
  account_id: number;
  label?: string;
  is_invoice_default?: boolean; // NEW
};
```

---

## Testing

### Automated Test
**File:** `test-payment-defaults.mjs`

Test coverage:
1. ✅ Login and authentication
2. ✅ Fetch payment method mappings with `is_invoice_default`
3. ✅ Update mappings to set invoice default
4. ✅ Verify update was successful
5. ✅ Validate multiple defaults are rejected

**Test Output:**
```
🔐 Logging in... ✅
📥 Fetching payment method mappings... ✅
🔄 Testing update with invoice default flag... ✅
✅ Verification: Invoice default: CASH ✅
🎉 All tests passed! ✅
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Navigate to Settings → Payment Methods
- [ ] Check "Invoice Default" for one payment method
- [ ] Save and verify
- [ ] Go to Sales → Payments
- [ ] Click "Create Payment"
- [ ] Verify account is auto-selected
- [ ] Try to set multiple defaults (should fail with error)

## Benefits

1. **⏱️ Time Savings:** Reduces clicks/keystrokes when creating invoice payments
2. **✅ Fewer Errors:** Pre-selected account reduces chance of selecting wrong account
3. **🎯 Better UX:** Clear visual indicator of default in settings
4. **🔒 Validated:** API prevents invalid configurations
5. **📱 Flexible:** Users can still override default if needed

---

## Architecture Decisions

### ✅ Why outlet_payment_method_mappings?
- Already handles payment method → account mapping
- Flexible system (no CHECK constraint on method codes)
- Used by both POS and backoffice
- Avoids creating redundant tables

### ✅ Why only is_invoice_default?
- Cashiers manually select payment methods at POS (no need for default)
- Keeps implementation simple and focused
- Easier to maintain and understand

### ✅ Why application-level validation?
- More flexible error messages
- Easier to change validation rules
- Avoids complex DB triggers
- Consistent with existing codebase patterns

---

## Migration Path

For existing installations with data:

```sql
-- Optionally set the first CASH mapping as default
UPDATE outlet_payment_method_mappings
SET is_invoice_default = 1
WHERE method_code = 'CASH'
  AND company_id = ?
  AND outlet_id = ?
LIMIT 1;
```

---

## Next Steps

### Deployment
1. Apply migration: `0027_outlet_payment_default_flags.sql`
2. Deploy API changes
3. Deploy frontend changes
4. Notify users about new feature

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
- [ ] Add default per user/role (if different users prefer different defaults)
- [ ] Add payment method icons/colors for better visual distinction
- [ ] Track usage statistics per payment method
- [ ] Add quick action: "Use default" button to reset to default

---

## Rollback Plan

If needed to rollback:

```sql
-- Remove index
DROP INDEX idx_outlet_payment_invoice_default 
  ON outlet_payment_method_mappings;

-- Remove column
ALTER TABLE outlet_payment_method_mappings 
  DROP COLUMN is_invoice_default;
```

Then revert code changes and redeploy.

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Why not use a separate table for defaults?**
A: Would add complexity without benefit. The flag approach is simpler and more maintainable.

**Q: What if user deletes the default payment method?**
A: The flag is removed with the row. System gracefully handles no default (shows warning).

**Q: Can different outlets have different defaults?**
A: Yes! Defaults are per outlet_id.

**Q: Can we have multiple defaults for different contexts?**
A: Not currently, but easy to add (e.g., `is_ecommerce_default`) in the future.
